# React Challenge

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to create a modern [React](https://react.dev/) app compatible with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

## Goals

- Use redux-thunk to trigger an API call to fetch data from [Periodic-Table-JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON/master/PeriodicTableJSON.json)
- Use tests to ensure the data is displayed correctly
- Having a good developer experience. (and having fun!)

## Scripts

Keep in mind that this project was created using `yarn`. If you are using `npm` or `pnpm`, you can replace `yarn` with `npm` or `pnpm` respectively.

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner

## Docker scripts

- `docker-compose up -d` - run docker container
- `docker-compose down` - stop docker container
